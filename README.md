Abstraction names should be relatively self-explanatory.

some abstractions need [pdkvabs](https://github.com/derekxkwan/pdkvabs) (whose contents should be flattened into one folder)

dkezfreeverb~ based around Katja Vetter's May 2012 implementation of freeverb with vanilla objects (will tidy up soon)
